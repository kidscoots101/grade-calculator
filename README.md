# Grade-Calculator (aka Gradulator)
I created this to help calculate my test scores for the year. It includes allowing you to group different exams into different folders.
You can add as many subjects you wish and how many papers there are per subject. 
# Functions
- You are able to calculate the final grade based on the weightage of each individual paper respectively.
- You are able to have on overview of your grade (e.g. A1) on the home page of the app.
- You are able to key in a percentage weightage, and max score attained for each paper for each subject respectively.
